# Python School Projects Repository

Repository for school projects and tests about Data Analytics, Machine Learning and Neural Networks.
These are all beginner level projects that we made in school to practice tools like Pandas, Sklearn, Tensorflow etc.

The repository will be divided in folders, and each one will focus on one tool in particular. The projects will be uploaded as commented Jupyter Notebooks.
